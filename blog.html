      <h3>The Comforts in being Alone</h3>
      <p>There was always an idea inside my head that we should always have somebody when we are doing something. When I was a kid, I was always afraid of going outside to mingle with others specially when I don't know the place. This fear of having no-one beside me made me miss a lot of opportunities, may it be making new friends, or exploring new places.<p>

      <p>It was only when I went to college that I realized that being by myself shouldn't be that scary. There are a lot of things that you would notice when you are alone that you might miss when you are with another company.It was then that I finally decided to leave my comfort zone of always being with someone, I actively went out and do things by myself, most of the things I did were some that I have always wanted to do. May it be simple like, watching a movie alone, travelling alone or just having a trip somewhere where you don't know anybody. </p>

      <p>At first it was really scary, being unfamiliar with where you are can make you really careful but at the same time, the experiences that you will have would be life changing in a way. I remember my first solo trip outside the country, it was a long vacation by myself where I would go out and see what the world has to offer. It was then that I truly appreciated the wonders of the world. Meeting new people and listening to their stories made my views about the world really expand. I can almost remember the aunties that I have talked to, although they were having a hard time with interacting with me in english. They were still really happy while sharing their life stories with me. </p>

      <p>Being alone also made me really think about what I want to do with my life, there were always thoughts in my head that </p>
      <em>"I should already be succesful by this or that age"</em> 
      <p>but I realized that it's alright to take my time with things. The burden that I had for so long began to lessen slowly and I started to enjoy the journey that I have in my life. I know that things are messy specially during the past few years with the pandemic but I always look at the bright side of things and say to myself that everything will be alright in the future </p>

      <p>With everything that happened so far, I think that I can say that now I am comfortable with being alone, I can freely do things all by myself that used to scared me at the past. There are truly a lot of comforts when you are used to being alone, one of it is that you can freely go out and do what you want, a lot of people are usually afraid to do some things in their life. Most often than not, the reason for them not doing it is that they do not have someone to do it with, maybe it is going to a concert, watching a gig from your favorite band or going somewhere that has always been in your bucket list. These activities can be done even if you are alone, it might be scary at first but you would have a great time if you stepped out of your comfort zone and did it regardlessly.  </p>

      <p>There are also quite a lot of importance in being alone, sometimes it may help you think more logically and better assess the situation that you are in. Most of the times our thoughts are being bombarded by noises may it be from noises from our surroundings or the lingering opinions of others that we often take into account. The comfort of being alone allows you to drop all the thoughts that you previously have, and focus on the important things that should matter. It gives us a sense of freedom to think for ourself and make our own decisions. I'm not saying that you should disregard all the inputs from other people, what I'm trying to say is that you should make the decision yourself by thinking about all the pros and cons of something and deciding for yourself what you really want.</p>

      <p>The person we would spend the most time with in this world is ourselves, so it should be really important that we learn how to enjoy life by being alone sometimes and experience new things together so that we may appreciate all the things that are happening around us specially when we are with our loved ones. There was always a populer saying where it goes, you would only know the worth of something when you have lost it. I think that is a really great saying, because it would make us cherish the things that we most often times than not, neglect to pay attention to because we are focusing only on what we want. We fail to see the blessings that are coming our way everyday. I do hope that we do not forget to cherish every blessings that may come, may it be the smallest ones for it will also bring us happiness so that we can enjoy the comforts of life fully.</p>
